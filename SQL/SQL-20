"Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, 
product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. 
Sort the output first by month and then by product ID."

SELECT DATE_PART('month', submit_date::DATE) AS mth, product_id as product, ROUND(AVG(stars), 2) AS avg_stars 
FROM reviews
GROUP BY mth, product
ORDER BY mth, product;
